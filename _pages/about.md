Hi, I am Arun, a *Computer Science* graduate with a **Master's degree** from **North Carolina State University**. My academic pursuits and internships have given me exposure to the latest advancements in Data Science and Machine Learning. I have a passion for applying these technologies to solve business problems, and I am excited about the opportunities to make a positive impact.

- I like Machine Learning.
- I like Natural Language Processing.
- I like Software Engineering.

I would love to combine all three of these to solve real-world problems and building applications.

My interests lies in the application of ML & NLP techniques. I am currently working as a **Research Assistant** at **North Carolina State University** and researching on applying NLP techniques to find the existing prejudices in Social Media. In another project, I am leading the data collection procedures and improving the performance of an AI agent for solving algebra equations. I have hands-on experience in causal relations analysis and have developed a toolkit for the same during my internship at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.

My bachelor's degree from *PES University, Bangalore, India*, has given me a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics. During this study I was intrigued by the replication of human brain with the neural network and then later I choose machine learning became my area of interest. I have worked on various projects in the field of machine learning.

> **1. Natural Language Processing (CSC791)**  
> Learnt and applied concepts of lexicons, grammar (like CCG and CFG, Jurafsky's grammar), and entities. Explored different types of embeddings and parsing techniques. Processed computationally ill-suited and inefficient, high-dimensional, unstructured text data by implementing TF-IDF, LSTM, XLNet, RoBERTa, and SVM.  
As part of the course, I have implemented sarcasm detection, first by creating a dataset, then by using embedding and tokenization for pre-processing. Later used Bi-LSTM and RoBERTa for classification.([CODE](https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Sarcasm-Detection))

> **2. Software Engineering (CSC510)**  
> Understood the basic software development life cycle and the different phases of software development. I have learned the different software design patterns and architecture principles. I have also used different software testing methods and tools. As a part of the course, developed a chatbot using REST API, nodeJs, and MongoDB to help developers by being the peesonalized code assistant.

> **3. Neural Networks (CSC591)**  
> Learnt the linear algebra and math principles behind neural architectures. Implemented different neural networks such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GAN. As part of the course, developed brain tumor detection in MRI images using CNN. ([CODE](https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Brain-Tumor-Detection))

> **4. Automated Learning and Data Analysis (CSC522)**  
> Implemented some basic ML algorithms such as Linear and Logistic regression, RFC, and SVM. Understood the importance of data analysis and data visualization. As part of the course, completed a project on wildfire-cause prediction. ([CODE](https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Wildfire-cause-prediction)) -->

1. **Context-based Sarcasm Detection**  
**Arun Gaonkar**, Manasi Ghosalkar  
Learnt to use transformer-based RoBERTa and Bi-LSTM for text processing on a news dataset. (<a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Sarcasm-Detection/blob/main/agaonka_termPaper.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Sarcasm-Detection" target="_blank">CODE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Sarcasm-Detection/blob/main/NLP%20Demo.pdf" target="_blank">PPT</a>)

    * Curated a news dataset of 28,000+ entries using BeautifulSoup. Pre-processed using pandas and numpy (ETL).
    * Investigated context dependency for sarcasm detection by employing embedding & tokenization by NLTK libraries.
    * Developed and trained Bi-LSTM & RoBERTa models for sarcasm detection, achieved 96% classification accuracy.

2. **Example Bot â€“ Personalized Code Assistant**  
**Arun Gaonkar**, Mohan Kanaka, Vinay Vasudev, Adarsh Narayanaswamy  
A chatbot built by applying software principles using MongoDB, Express, NodeJS (MEN) stack, and Javascript. (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LcEMi9sS8UlYxKTcIx9UkuCYGLf8VS0B/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Video</a>)  

    * Designed a chatbot to assist developers to create, store and retrieve personalized code snippets and API examples.
    * Deployed server-based chatbot for CRUD operations on MongoDB by leveraging Ansible, Git bash & CI/CD pipeline.
    * Improved test coverage to 96% by utilizing unit testing with Chai & Mocha following scrum & agile methodologies.

3. **Wildfire Data Analysis and Cause Prediction**  
**Arun Gaonkar**, Ganesh Thanu, Nikhil Patil  
Implemented ETL by scripting with pandas and numpy, learned data visualization techniques with matplotlib and seaborn. (<a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Wildfire-cause-prediction/blob/main/P24_WildFireCausePrediction.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Wildfire-cause-prediction/blob/main/ALDA_Project.ipynb" target="_blank">CODE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Wildfire-cause-prediction/blob/main/PID24_Wildfire_Cause_Prediction_slides.pdf" target="_blank">PPT</a>)  

    * Led a team of 3 to build an end-to-end machine learning solution for wildfire cause prediction.
    * Analyzed 1.88 million records using pipelined ETL, data visualization techniques such as matplotlib and seaborn.
    * Employed models like RFC, KNN, Bi-LSTM, CNN to predict wildfire reason. Best accuracy of 93% was achieved by CNN.

4. **Brain Tumor Image Classification**  
Learnt image classification and segmentation techniques by applying CNN, and R-CNN. (<a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Brain-Tumor-Detection/blob/main/videos/projF3_final_video.mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ArunGaonkar/Brain-Tumor-Detection/blob/main/ProjectF4_Team27_Report.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)

    * Developed MRI image classification models by training deep learning models like Bi-LSTM & CNN using TensorFlow.
    * Improved classification accuracy to 92% by optimizing hyperparameters.

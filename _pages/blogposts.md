# 2. Eduroam wifi at institutions is one of the best facility for students

*(Date: 08/10/2023)*

Eduroam is a game-changer for students about how they want to use the internet. I came across Eduroam when I started doing my Master's at NCSU. It helped me to connect to the internet everywhere around the university and also helped me when I traveled to different universities.

[Eduroam](https://eduroam.org) is a global wifi network that allows students to connect to the internet at any institution that has eduroam wifi. "Eduroam provides simple, easy, secure connectivity from thousands of hotspots across more than 100 countries." And another interesting fact about eduroam is that it provides the most secure encryption and authentication standards available. Eduroam supports over 5 million access authentications every day with over 500,000 international authentications daily.

I believe this is a great initiative and I hope it will be available in every institution around the world. I am glad that students and researchers can take full advantage of this facility at no cost.

# 1.  Copying from one Google sheet to another google sheet

*(Date: 05/14/2023)*

I am wondering why I cannot paste only values from one google sheet to another google sheet. I can paste the formualas (ctrl + v) works but (ctrl+ shift + v) does not work.

For example, consider I have a google spreadsheet file named as "Sheet1" with multiple sheets inside it, named "Alpha" and "Beta". I wanted to paste only the values of "Alpha" sheet to a new google spreadsheet file named as "Sheet2".

If I copy all the contents of "Alpha" sheet and do ctrl + shift + v in "Sheet2", it does not work. But if I do ctrl + v, it works but I am getting different values because of reference error.

Resolving this issue. Create a new temporary sheet "temp" in "Sheet1". I had to copy the contents of "Alpha" and do ctrl + shift + v in "temp". Then right click on "temp" and select "Copy to" and then "Existing spreadsheet" and select "Sheet2" going through all of my directories. Such a hassale process..!!

Why can't we do ctrl + shift + v in "Sheet2" directly? Why do we have to create a temporary sheet and then copy to "Sheet2"?
